BitTrack is a custom-built version control system inspired by Git, created with a vision to showcase the potential of Arab innovation in the tech world. Developed with "Jordanian hands," BitTrack empowers developers with complete control over project versions, history, and collaboration workflows. With BitTrack, you can seamlessly track changes, commit snapshots, and manage file histories, all designed for efficient project management and robust version control.

This project is driven by a belief: it is time to start developing our own systems rather than relying solely on those created in the West. We have the capability, talent, and determination to build tools that serve our unique needs and showcase our technical prowess. BitTrack is a step toward proving that we can indeed develop solutions on par with global standards.

Looking forward, the ambition is to expand BitTrack into a comprehensive platform like GitHub, a collaborative hub based on BitTrack’s core technology. This platform will allow users to share, manage, and contribute to projects, establishing BitTrack as a proud representation of Arab talent in the global tech community.

I invite everyone passionate about version control and open-source software to join us in developing BitTrack into a stable, powerful versioning system. Your contributions, ideas, and skills are invaluable in transforming BitTrack into a fully-fledged tool that developers around the world can rely on. Let’s build this vision together!
