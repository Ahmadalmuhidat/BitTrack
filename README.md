# BitTrack – Personal Version Control System
A comprehensive, lightweight version control system built from scratch in C++—offering full offline control without cloud dependency. BitTrack provides Git-like functionality with a focus on simplicity, performance, and educational value.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Repository Management**: Initialize, clone, and manage BitTrack repositories
- **Branching**: Create, switch, merge, and delete branches
- **Staging**: Add, remove, and manage staged files
- **Committing**: Create commits with messages and metadata
- **Diffing**: View changes between commits, branches, and working directory
- **Stashing**: Temporarily save and restore uncommitted changes
- **Tagging**: Create and manage lightweight and annotated tags
- **Merging**: Merge branches with conflict resolution support

### Advanced Features
- **Git-like Ignore System**: Pattern matching with precedence rules (`.bitignore`)
- **Hooks System**: Pre-commit, post-commit, and pre-push hooks
- **Repository Maintenance**: Cleanup, optimization, and integrity checking
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and validation
- **Remote Operations**: Push/pull to remote repositories
- **Configuration Management**: User and repository-specific settings

## Requirements

### System Requirements
- **Operating System**: macOS, Linux, or Windows
- **Compiler**: GCC 7+ or Clang 5+ with C++17 support
- **Dependencies**: 
  - OpenSSL (for hashing)
  - libcurl (for remote operations)
  - zlib (for compression)
  - Google Test (for testing)
